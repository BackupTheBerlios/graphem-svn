0.1:
use hashed pattern
config file?
can i iterate to possible combinations (instead of recursion)?


0.2:
make Auth a base class
check if input is valid when using --pattern
don't show mouse cursor, maybe only record relative movements (except for tablets)?
current brute force algorithm is quite slow
	maybe generate possible patterns directly from input,
	assign probabilities to each pattern,

creating a new auth pattern:
	estimate entropy of input
	repeat input a few times, try to find common elements
	maybe generate a random pattern instead of recording


0.3:
create documentation
create real gui
	create/record pattern
	try pattern a few times
	offer to save pattern


?:
support real handwriting
	try different algorithms for Auth module:
	fcc-codes (current implementation):
		doesn't seem to be very reliable (why?)
		- useless for handwriting, kanji
		+ simple geometric patterns work
	maybe something else:
		element: cusp, straight line, loop; also store direction
		still missing velocity, probably helpful
use pattern to access encryption key, should be possible with QCA
