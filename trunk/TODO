0.4:
fix inconsistent naming
handle input == 0 in Auth
NewPattern::auth needed?
debug module
make creation of new pattern slightly more wizardish
	choosing plugins?
secure storage, zero memory after use
better logo & home page

?:
l10n
estimate strength of input
search for straight lines and assign a direction to the whole thing. should help with 22 degree lines
make preprocess() suck less, use velocity to determine averaging
do some benchmarking
	test wether manual inlining makes sense
	test if hash comparison can be optimized (QByteArray vs. QString vs ?)
	QCryptoGraphicHash vs QCA::Hash
support real handwriting
	try different algorithm for Auth module:
	element: cusp, straight line, loop; also store direction
	still missing velocity, probably helpful
don't show mouse cursor, maybe only record relative movements (except for tablets)?
