0.2:
inputwidget:
	disable input when pattern not set
	add "record" mode
	messages don't really fit right now
how to switch between testing and edit?
	just change everythig?
	tabs?
	provide list of patterns?

remove command line arguments:
		--pattern (or keep for quick testing?)
		--touchpad (stored along with pattern)
record pattern
	display recognized strokes (startpos, length, direction)

0.3:
can i optimize the tryPattern() algorithm so patterns are tried in order of likelihood?
create documentation
generate random pattern
estimate entropy of input

?:
test wether manual inlining makes sense
make Auth a base class
support real handwriting
	try different algorithms for Auth module:
	fcc-codes (current implementation):
		doesn't seem to be very reliable (why?)
		- useless for handwriting, kanji
		+ simple geometric patterns work
	maybe something else:
		element: cusp, straight line, loop; also store direction
		still missing velocity, probably helpful
use pattern to access encryption key, should be possible with QCA
don't show mouse cursor, maybe only record relative movements (except for tablets)?

does hashing really make sense? Find out just what part of the total keyspace we have to try on average...
if a pattern is supposed to be secure, we can only try a number of keys which is many orders of magnitude less
