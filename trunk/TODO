0.4:
make Auth a base class
	move statistics somewhere else
	number of tries doesn't really belong there
is QCA's rng enough?
	should probably use openssl, otherwise disable patten generator
integrate with windows
	+pasword might disable Ctrl Alt Del?
better logo & home page

?:
l10n
estimate strength of input
create test cases for specific inputs
(!) search for straight lines and assign a direction to the whole thing. should help with 22 degree lines
can i optimize the tryPattern() algorithm so patterns are tried in order of likelihood?
make preprocess() suck less, use velocity to determine averaging
do some benchmarking
	test wether manual inlining makes sense
	test if hash comparison can be optimized (QByteArray vs. QString vs ?)
	QCryptoGraphicHash vs QCA::Hash
support real handwriting
	try different algorithms for Auth module:
	fcc-codes (current implementation):
		doesn't seem to be very reliable (why?)
		- useless for handwriting, kanji
		+ simple geometric patterns work
	maybe something else:
		element: cusp, straight line, loop; also store direction
		still missing velocity, probably helpful
PAM integration?
use pattern to access encryption key, should be possible with QCA
add fancy graphics to auth dialog
don't show mouse cursor, maybe only record relative movements (except for tablets)?
