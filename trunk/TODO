0.4:
NewPattern::auth needed?
redesign interface
make creation of new pattern slightly more wizardish
	choosing plugins?
plugins really shouldn't depend on InputWidget
improve FCC's preprocess()
secure storage, zero memory after use
resolution change issues:
	window not in front
	white screen

?:
l10n
estimate strength of input
search for straight lines and assign a direction to the whole thing. should help with 22 degree lines
make preprocess() suck less, use velocity to determine averaging
support real handwriting
	try different algorithm for Auth module:
	element: cusp, straight line, loop; also store direction
	still missing velocity, probably helpful
don't show mouse cursor, maybe only record relative movements (except for tablets)?
