Introduction
============

Graphem is a small mouse gesture based authentication program and screen locker
for X11.
Project home page: http://graphem.berlios.de/


Installation
============

Graphem requires Qt4 and QCA2 libraries, please install the development
libraries (called libqt4-dev and libqca2-dev on Debian/Ubuntu) before
compilation via:
	qmake-qt4
	make


Configuration
=============

The configuration window is shown when Graphem is started without any arguments.
You can now set a new key gesture via File -> New Gesture. You can either draw
your own gesture or let Graphem generate a random key for you by clicking the
'Generate' button.
After accepting the displayed gesture you should test wether it is recognized
correctly in the main window.  To increase the recognition rate, it often helps
to speed up mouse movements.  For your own key gestures you should make sure to
only include strokes that are present each time it is drawn.
When you are satisfied with the results, use File -> Save to save the new key
gesture to disk, overwriting the previous one (if any).
In the preferences dialog (File -> Preferences) you can configure the amount of
time Graphem may spend trying to match the input to your key gesture before
you can retry. You may want to increase the timeout for older machines or
pariticularly long keys, for most other cases it is usually more effective to
re-input your gesture than to do an exhaustive search.
If you aren't concerned about 'shoulder surfing' you can also have it display
your input while authenticating.


Locking the screen
==================

To lock the screen, add the --lock argument when executing Graphem.
You should test your key gesture a few times in the configuration window so
you don't lock yourself out.


Scripting
=========

When calling Graphem from a script, you'll want to use the --ask argument.
The user can then enter their key gesture or press ESC to cancel the dialog.
Return code 0 indicates success, 1 means the dialog was canceled or the number
of possible tries was exceeded. To set the number of tries, add --tries [n]
to the command line. The default allows an infinite number of retries.
