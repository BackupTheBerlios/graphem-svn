TODO...


Locking the screen
==================

To lock the screen, add the --lock argument when executing Graphem.
You should test your key pattern a few times in the configuration window so
you don't lock yourself out.


Scripting
=========

When calling Graphem from a script, you'll want to use the --ask argument.
The user can then enter their key pattern or press ESC to cancel the dialog.
Return code 0 indicates success, 1 means the dialog was canceled or the number
of possible tries was exceeded. To set the number of tries, add --tries [n]
to the command line. The default allows an infinite number of retries.
